# go-navidrome-ratings-sync

Sync local MP3/FLAC ratings with Navidrome through the Subsonic API.

## Navidrome requirement

This tool depends on Navidrome returning the real filesystem path for tracks via the Subsonic API.

Set this environment variable on your Navidrome instance:

```bash
ND_SUBSONIC_DEFAULTREPORTREALPATH=true
```

Without it, Navidrome may not return the real track path, which breaks path-based matching and makes sync results unreliable.
